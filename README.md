# stanford_beamer_presentation
This is an unofficial LaTeX Beamer presentation template with Stanford University theme.

Feel free to use this template for your project presentations, conference talks, etc.

The repository includes an example `.tex` file and an example presentation slides of my own (no `.tex` source code provided).
